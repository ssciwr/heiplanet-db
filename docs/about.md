# About

## Project Overview

The Heiplanet platform is a comprehensive surveillance system designed to monitor and visualize mosquito-borne disease risk across European regions. The platform integrates climate data, epidemiological models, and geographic information to provide actionable insights for public health decision-makers, researchers, and policy planners.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Disease Risk Assessment**: Transmission suitability calculations for West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne diseases
- **Geographic Coverage**: European-wide monitoring at NUTS (Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) regional level
- **High-Resolution Data**: Global climate data at 0.1° spatial resolution
- **Interactive Visualization**: Web-based mapping interface for exploring spatial and temporal disease patterns
- **Open Science**: Transparent, reproducible data processing pipeline with full data provenance

### Platform Components

The Heiplanet platform consists of four integrated components:

1. **[Webserver/Frontend](https://github.com/ssciwr/heiplanet-frontend)**: Interactive web interface for data visualization and exploration
2. **[Model Backend](https://github.com/ssciwr/onehealth-model-backend)**: Epidemiological models for disease transmission calculations
3. **[Data Lake & Database Backend](https://github.com/ssciwr/heiplanet-db)**: This repository - data storage, processing pipeline, and API
4. **[Data Preprocessor](https://github.com/ssciwr/heiplanet-data)**: Climate and environmental data preprocessing tools

## Research Group

### Heidelberg Planetary Health Hub (Hei-Planet)

The project is led by the [Heidelberg Planetary Health Hub (Hei-Planet)](https://hei-planet.com/), an interdisciplinary research initiative at Heidelberg University focusing on the connections between environmental change, ecosystem health, and human disease.

Hei-Planet brings together expertise in:
- Climate science and environmental modeling
- Infectious disease epidemiology
- Vector biology and ecology
- Public health surveillance
- Data science and spatial analysis

## Development Group

### Scientific Software Center (SSC)
